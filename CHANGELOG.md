# Changelog

All notable changes to **omp-web** (`@kahme247/ompweb`) are documented in this file.

---

## Unreleased

### Added

- Manage native per-tool approval dictionary entries in Safety & Approvals, including custom and MCP tool names, literal policy keys, server-baselined entry creation and scoped inheritance, with English, Chinese and Japanese guidance.
- Show native effective values separately from saved overrides across Settings, Retry & fallback and the Native OMP registry. Choose global/profile or workspace scope, restore inheritance per field, inspect the automatic-thinking ceiling, and see unsupported capabilities and application timing in English, Chinese and Japanese.
- Align Agents with native project-first discovery, extension/npm-link and marketplace sources, real `task.disabledAgents` toggles, model overrides and effort constraints. Preserve template metadata and explicit empty tools with field-level conflict checks; clear both thinking aliases, refresh bundled caches by binary/version, and distinguish template declarations from native runtime model evidence in English, Chinese and Japanese.
- Choose **Classifier** or **Vendor default** in Settings → AI Model Defaults → **Auto Thinking Source** when Reasoning is `auto`. The choice is saved in omp's native config for newly started or restarted agents. Vendor mode prefers the publisher's effort, then omp's per-model default, then normal Auto fallback. Requires an omp release containing [can1357/oh-my-pi#14114](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/14114).
- Show conflicting skill names and deduplicated installations when an OMP session starts, with resolution details, a **×** button that dismisses the notice for the session until the diagnostic report changes, and a persisted **Turn off** action that disables startup notices. Inspect a running session manually in **Settings → Extensions & Tools → Skills**, even when notices are off; inspection never resumes a stopped session. Requires an OMP runtime with the skill-diagnostics RPC commands; older runtimes report live diagnostics as unavailable.
- Ask a side question with `/btw <question>`: omp answers from the current conversation in a panel above the composer, even while the agent is working, and the question never enters the chat. Cancel a running answer, copy it, or ask follow-ups in the same topic. `/btw` on its own lists the session's past side questions, including ones asked in the terminal, each expandable to all its turns with **Copy** and **Follow up**. Side questions are text-only: with an attachment in the composer, `/btw` is refused and the draft is kept. An answer that omp lost (for example after its process restarted) shows as **Interrupted** instead of spinning. Requires an omp with the `btw` RPC commands; older omp shows "/btw requires a newer omp" instead of sending the text to the model.
- Show omp's Claude usage-limit badge in the composer toolbar, matching the terminal status line during the wrap-up allowance or once `/slow` low priority takes over. Reset times use the browser's locale and timezone. Requires an omp version whose `get_state` reports structured `usageLimit` state.
- Add a **Slow** toggle next to **Fast** in the composer toolbar, the equivalent of omp's `/slow`. On Claude models it turns low priority on or off in your omp settings, so it applies to every session and terminal; on OpenAI and Google models it switches this session to the provider's flex tier. Once the session's omp process runs, the toggle follows omp's `get_state` (`slowModeSupported`); before that, including in a new session, it follows the selected model's provider (`anthropic`, `openai`, `openai-codex`, `google`, `google-vertex`) and, on Claude, the `providers.anthropic.slowMode` setting. Clicking it there starts the session's omp process.
- Show the composer's reasoning level with TUI-style icons, alongside its name on desktop and without the name on narrow toolbars. The menu pairs each icon with its level name. Icons use consistent, vertically centered shapes rather than font-dependent Unicode glyphs, with larger mobile controls, smaller desktop controls, and support for high-contrast colors. Keep the model icon visible on phones and reduce unused space between the model and reasoning controls without wrapping the standard toolbar controls. Provider-defined levels retain their names with normal truncation.
- Keep the reasoning menu in one column on phones as well as desktop, with one full-width level per row instead of side-by-side chips.
- Add **Paste image** to the composer's **+** menu, with Japanese and Simplified Chinese translations. Requires HTTPS (or localhost), browser support for clipboard image reads, and clipboard permission; the item is hidden where the browser cannot read images from the clipboard. Attaching a file remains available.
- Name web app installations, iOS home-screen titles, and browser tabs after the server's hostname (without port), so multiple servers can be told apart. Localhost and IP addresses keep the generic `omp web` name; named LAN hosts are preserved. Tabs show `workspace - installation name`. Existing installations may need to be re-added to pick up the new name.
- Create a workspace by cloning a Git repository: in the **Add workspace** dialog, enter an `https://` or ssh URL and choose **Clone here** to clone into a new folder under the selected directory, which then becomes the active workspace. Clone progress streams into the dialog; **Cancel clone** stops git and deletes the partial clone. git never prompts, so private repositories need a credential helper or ssh agent.
- Add a manual refresh button to the sidebar's Provider Usage panel, with the same success feedback as workspace refresh. Manual refresh bypasses omp-web's usage cache and invalidates omp's cached reports before fetching fresh limits; automatic five-minute refresh remains unchanged. Manual refresh requires an omp that supports `usage invalidate`; an unsupported or failed refresh shows as unavailable instead of reporting success.
- Add an off-by-default **Resume running sessions after a restart** setting in Settings → System & Updates. When omp-web restarts while agents are working, it restarts those sessions and prompts each with "Session interrupted and resumed. Continue as you would have done without the interruption." Work in progress at the moment of the restart, such as a running command, is lost. Do not also resume those sessions from a terminal while omp-web is down.
- Add **Copy** and **Markdown** below user messages and completed assistant replies, with keyboard access and touch-sized controls. Copy only message text, excluding thinking, tool output, and renderer controls; preserve full source for oversized raw-text messages. Shorten message actions to **Fork** and **Read** to leave more room on mobile; the speech tooltip and accessible label remain **Read aloud**.
- Scope Ctrl+A / Cmd+A to the selected message, currently loaded chat, or active file contents instead of the whole page. Message selection includes collapsed extension previews and expanded details without toolbar labels. Newer pane focus takes precedence over retained child selections. Text fields and IME composition retain native behavior; browser-menu commands and embedded viewers remain browser-controlled.
- Add an off-by-default **Scope native Select All (experimental)** switch in Settings → Interface & Behavior. The per-browser preference narrows whole-page selections from native menus while leaving keyboard scoping independent. Disable it if browser selection handles or menus behave unexpectedly; intentional whole-page selections can also be narrowed.
- Play back a voice recording before transcribing or sending it. Pause keeps a left-side preview control; Stop opens a review deck with play, discard, and transcribe-and-send.
- Link GitHub issue and pull-request references in chat messages. Bare `#123` links to the session checkout's GitHub repository (the `gh` default remote, else `upstream`, `github`, then `origin`); `owner/repo#123` links to that repository. Code spans and existing links are left unchanged.
- Show all of an agent's ask-tool questions in one panel, with checkboxes for multi-select, radio buttons for single-select (recommended option marked and preselected), and an **Other** free-text answer per question, submitted together. Requires an omp that supports `set_ask_dialog`; older omp keeps the one-question-at-a-time dialog.
- Make `agent://<id>` subagent handles in chat messages clickable. Bare handles, inline code containing only a handle, and Markdown links open that subagent's result dialog; `agent://Parent/Child` opens the nested `Parent.Child` subagent when the roster knows it. A `read` of an `agent://` handle opens the same dialog from its tool row.
- Show the full model name, including its provider (for example `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5-5`), and the reasoning effort in the subagent result dialog, for running subagents and for finished ones after a reload. Finished background subagents take them from their saved transcript, so they also appear in the composer's subagent chips.
- Attach images and text files while the agent is running, and send them with a steer or a queued follow-up. Attaching through **+**, paste, or drag and drop now works during a run; with only attachments in the composer, **Stop** becomes **Queue**. An image-only message shows as `[Image]` in the queue. A steer or follow-up that omp refuses returns to the composer with its images, and so does a queued message taken back by **Edit** or **Stop**. Getting images back from **Edit** and **Stop** requires an omp with `abort_and_restore_queue` and image-returning `remove_queued_message` ([can1357/oh-my-pi#14179](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/14179)); older omp returns only the text.

### Fixes & Improvements

- Keep tool authorization and execution under native `allow` / `prompt` / `deny` policies. Web confirmation titles no longer trigger automatic approval from the legacy `extension` entry; tool, login and editor requests wait for user responses. Per-entry changes preserve sibling policies, punctuation, comments and same-field conflict protection.
- Save explicit native-setting operations with per-field baselines: unrelated CLI edits merge, same-field edits return a visible conflict, and YAML comments, unknown data, explicit empty values and legacy compaction intent are retained. Use native enum/numeric domains, including `strict`, `sharpshooter` and values outside former UI caps. Preserve global `config.yaml`; explain and protect the project `config.yaml` target ignored by OMP 18.8.4. Failed native/YAML queries remain read-only; configuration saves refresh registry consumers after active utility work without stopping sessions.
- Balance the composer icons on phones and narrow toolbars with a slightly smaller effort-level icon and a larger Slow-mode snail, while keeping menu icon sizes unchanged.
- Keep the model picker on the left and reasoning effort, Fast, Slow, microphone, and Send/Stop controls in a right-aligned composer group, including wrapped mobile rows.
- The Provider Usage panel now shows each account's email instead of omp's redacted form (`an*`); accounts without an email show as **Account N**. Only the email, plan and limits reach the browser.
- The composer's reasoning menu now uses the same borderless rows as the model picker instead of bordered cards.
- The context popover now uses the room above the composer instead of a fixed 380px cap, so it only scrolls when the window is too short for it.
- Fix settings crashes, stalled session catch-up, and failed voice transcription polling in browsers without `AbortSignal.timeout`, `AbortSignal.any`, or `Promise.withResolvers`, including development-mode clients. Client requests now use `AbortController` timers and ordinary promises while retaining timeouts and cancellation (#196).
- Allow development requests from all RFC1918 private IPv4 ranges, not just `192.168.*.*`. Set `OMP_WEB_DEV_ORIGIN` to allow a tunnel or reverse-proxy hostname without editing `next.config.ts`; the setting is development-only.
- Fix authenticated app-installation metadata: serve `/api/manifest` through the existing password guard with one credentialed manifest link and embedded packaged PNG icons, avoiding cookie-free native installer icon downloads. Preserve the app identity and root launch URL/scope, retain private revalidating caching, and remove the obsolete public-manifest exception. Verified in local Chromium with HTTP icon URLs blocked and no installability errors; the owner also confirmed successful installation on a physical phone behind Cloudflare Access.
- Keep workspace names and their rename fields visible on narrow sidebars by showing the Git branch on a compact second line instead of letting it squeeze the project name. Keep the separator and activity indicator beside the workspace name on the first line; long branch names remain truncated and clickable for worktree selection, with a 24px-high tap target and enough row space to avoid overlapping the workspace name.
- The **Agent environment variables** editor in Settings → System & Updates now sits below its title and description and follows the page width, instead of sitting beside them and extending past the right edge. The text box also grows with its contents.
- Show queued steers and follow-ups on every device viewing a session. The queue panel now shows omp's own queue (omp 18.4.4 or later) instead of a copy kept by the tab that sent them, so it also stays correct across reloads.
- **Stop** no longer loses a queued steer or lets the agent run it anyway: as with Esc in omp's terminal, every message still waiting in the queue moves back into the composer. With omp's `abort_and_restore_queue` (newer omp), omp takes the queue back and aborts in one step, which also covers a steer you just promoted that this page's queue had not caught up with, and one the model already picked up through live steering (for example OpenAI models with `providers.openaiLiveSteering`). If that request fails, Stop retries it once and warns when the messages may not have come back. Older omp (18.4.4 or later) falls back to removing each message the page lists before the abort; there, a steer the page does not list or the model already took still runs after Stop, and attached images are dropped.
- Long voice transcriptions no longer fail with `Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON` behind a reverse proxy. The server now keeps the recording and transcribes it as a background job (up to about 5 minutes) while the browser polls short requests, so proxy timeouts no longer cut off a slow STT endpoint. The job survives the recording browser disconnecting: any browser showing the same session picks it up, can play the recording and retry a failure, and the transcript is inserted in exactly one browser. A **Transcribe and send** (or queue) choice stays with the job, so the transcript is still sent after you switch sessions and come back; if the agent is running by then it is queued as a follow-up, and a queue choice whose run has ended is sent. Another browser that finishes the job only inserts the text. **Transcribe and send** from the review deck now sends too. Recordings stay on the server (in memory) for up to an hour or until inserted or discarded. Anyone who can reach the omp-web API can list, play and retry those recordings by session, so set `OMP_WEB_PASSWORD` when omp-web is reachable by others.
- Sending a message to a live session no longer fails with **HTTP 404** when the session's transcript cannot be read. An empty baseline is used instead, so the prompt is still delivered. The previous behavior is what surfaced as `Failed to send message: HTTP 404` on sessions created by slash commands.
- The Skills page lists exactly what omp resolves, through `omp skill list --json` (omp 18.3.3 or later): plugin, custom-directory and registry skills appear, and colliding names show as `namespace/name`. Skills that live outside omp-web's skill folders, such as plugin installs, show a disabled toggle because an update would undo the edit. Older omp binaries keep the built-in scan.
- On phones, the top bar's **⋯** menu no longer repeats the session name already shown in the title, and its theme and language pickers open fully instead of being cut off at the bar's edge.
- **Resume running sessions after a restart** no longer resumes sessions that another running omp-web instance (for example a dev server sharing the same agent directory) is still running. Previously the second instance started duplicate agents that ran alongside the originals and wrote to the same session files.
- On phones and tablets, the first time the file panel opens it now takes keyboard focus, closes with Escape, and keeps Tab inside the panel, like every later open. Previously the first open left focus on the toggle button and ignored Escape. Closing the panel after that first open also returns focus to what opened it, such as a file link in the chat, instead of the page body.
- The Git side panel now honors `.gitattributes`: changed files marked `linguist-generated`, `linguist-vendored`, `linguist-documentation`, or `-diff` move into a collapsed "files marked in .gitattributes" group below the main list, and the panel previews the first unmarked change. `-diff` files show that their diff is suppressed, including untracked ones, instead of a generic "Diff unavailable". Files with the `binary` attribute stay in the main list.
- Stop showing tool paths such as `history://…`, `proc://…` and `local://…` as file links. They are resolved by omp, and clicking them opened an "Access denied" viewer tab. `http://` and `https://` paths passed to `read` now open the URL in a new browser tab instead.
- omp-web no longer exits when a browser disconnects in the middle of a POST request, for example when a tab closes while a request is still in flight. A Next.js bug (vercel/next.js#99278) could turn that disconnect into an uncaught `Error: aborted`, which the crash handler treated as fatal. These disconnects are now logged to `diagnostics.log` as `client-abort` and the server keeps running; every other uncaught error still exits.
- When `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` points away from `~/.omp/agent`, the crash journal (`diagnostics.log`) is written to `<agent dir>/omp-web/` instead of `~/.omp/omp-web/`, so isolated test and development servers no longer write to the real journal.
- Slide the file panel in from the right edge on phones, with the same timing as the left sidebar, instead of popping it open full-screen. The first open slides too, without a **Loading…** placeholder or a dimmed backdrop flashing over the chat. The panel still covers the whole screen once open, and it opens and closes instantly when reduced motion is enabled.
- On mobile, move the session information control (context ring with stats, tokens, cost, and **Compact context**) to the top-right of the top bar; desktop keeps it in the composer toolbar. Preserve the ring usage coloring, its popover, and the `/session` shortcut. Opening the panel moves focus into it; Escape dismisses it before run shortcuts and returns focus to its opener when focus is still within the panel.
- Make the mobile workspace sidebar full-screen without a dimmed backdrop, with a visible top-left close button. Place the file-panel opener inside the upper bar and add a separate top-right close button inside the file panel, with keyboard focus returning to its opener. Keep the session-title pill centered between the header controls.
- Continue the mobile file-panel tab-row border underneath its close-button cell, so the divider spans the full width.
- On mobile, swipe anywhere on the app surface: swipe right to open the left sidebar or close the right one, and swipe left for the opposite action. No device-edge start or perfectly straight movement is required. Recognition follows overall dominant-axis displacement and tolerates curved thumb movement, a brief corrective start, and shorter deliberate drags. Taps, predominantly vertical movement, multi-touch, text editing or selection, native horizontal scrolling, and open popups retain their normal behavior; persistent drawer lists, including Git changes, remain swipeable. Embedded previews retain native input and full width; swipe on their surrounding toolbar to close the sidebar.
- Let the centered session-title pill fit its content and grow for longer names up to the available header space, instead of stretching short names into a fixed-size box.
- Keep **Collapse input** available after expanding a long user message with **Show full input**, so the message can be collapsed again.
- Agent host tools (`open_url`, `notify`, `open_file`) no longer fail when you switch to another session mid-run. Any open omp-web tab now answers them, and a URL or file from a session you are not viewing opens only after you confirm it in a dialog.
- Ask before opening links from the agent. Turn on **Open agent links without asking** in Settings → Interface & Behavior to open links from the session you are viewing right away; links from other sessions always ask.
- An attached ask panel no longer steals focus after it opens. Typing in a question's **Other** box no longer selects the first option when the text begins with a space, and focus is never pulled back to a radio button once you have moved on.
- Keep every assistant reply visible in the chat. **Process details** now folds only the activity between replies (thinking, tool calls, notices), so a reply that ended a turn is no longer hidden when a background job or reminder resumes the agent.
- Honor omp's **Hide Thinking Blocks** setting in the chat, and rename the toggle from **Thinking Blocks** so its label matches what it does.
- Start system reminders, async job results, and late LSP diagnostics collapsed to their first line. Click the header to expand; reminder headers show their attributes, such as `reason` and `rule`.
- Render Nerd Font icons that omp sends when its symbol preset is set to Nerd (for example the multi-select **Done selecting** check mark) instead of empty boxes. The bundled symbols font (Nerd Fonts Symbols Only, SIL OFL 1.1, about 1.2 MB) applies only to Private Use Area codepoints and is downloaded only when a page shows one of these icons.
- Show late LSP diagnostic notices with their original line breaks, like async results, instead of collapsing them onto one line.
- Unexpected omp process exits now remain visible in the workspace and session sidebar until that session starts again, including the exit code or signal and the last stderr line.
- Show free-text answers to agent questions (the ask tool's "Other" option and other `promptStyle` editor requests) in the chat font instead of the monospace code font.
- Keep line breaks in agent dialog titles instead of running multi-line titles together on one line.
- Restore the Settings toggle track, which the 44px hit area had squeezed into a dot. Cap Settings dropdowns at half the card width with an ellipsis for long options, and stack them below their label at full card width on narrow screens.
- Give the top-bar theme picker the same padding and icon spacing as the language picker; its icon and arrow were squeezed into a 28px button.
- Improve phone and tablet ergonomics with safe-area-aware top chrome, a focus-trapped mobile workspace drawer, an actionable first-run workspace state, touch-sized sidebar actions, narrow-screen composer wrapping, clearer settings loading/retry states, and quieter streaming announcements.
- Keep the Extensions & Tools settings panel scrollable on desktop and touch layouts, including long MCP server lists.
- Let non-native settings tabs render while the common OMP configuration loads, and show static MCP configuration before live status resolution.
- Give the new-session workspace picker a calmer destination card with a folder badge, stronger focus and hover states, a compact path context line, and touch-friendly spacing while retaining the native accessible select behavior.
- Defer the file panel and its Explorer/Git work until first use, use a fixed overlay for the file panel on tablet widths, increase mobile Explorer row height, enlarge Git touch targets, and keep compact session context available in the mobile overflow menu.
- Move focus into attached extension requests, contain keyboard focus in the custom extension terminal, and add a local retry action when a text file cannot be loaded.
- Add local retry actions and status semantics to Explorer, Git, and text-file failure states so transient workspace errors are recoverable without hunting for a toolbar refresh control.
- Defer Explorer and Git tab work until each tab is first opened, avoiding duplicate status requests and hidden-panel overhead while preserving visited tab state.
- Pause content fetches and file-watch connections for inactive file tabs, then resume them when the tab becomes active to reduce background network and rendering work.
- Defer the command-palette chunk until the first Ctrl/Cmd+K shortcut, reducing initial shell work while preserving the existing keyboard workflow.
- Add a visible command-palette action in the topbar overflow menu with the Ctrl/Cmd+K shortcut exposed to assistive technology, while keeping the palette chunk lazy.
- Replace the generic file-panel loading label with a shape-matched skeleton toolbar and rows, giving desktop and mobile users a stable visual handoff while the deferred panel chunk loads.
- Enlarge mobile file-search controls and add inline refresh actions to sidebar load failures, keeping the primary navigation recoverable without relying on the header icon.
- Keep the full-page Settings header clear of notches and home indicators, and enlarge its search, back, and close controls for touch devices.
- Add a localized **Return to latest message** control that appears when a long conversation is scrolled away from the bottom, with reduced-motion-aware scrolling and touch-sized mobile controls.
- Replace the sidebar’s generic loading label with shape-matched workspace/session skeleton rows for a calmer first paint on desktop and mobile.
- Clarify the mobile file-panel control by switching from a panel icon to an explicit close icon when the panel is open, while retaining the existing accessible toggle labels.
- Enlarge mobile session-search and composer attachment-remove controls so common mobile cleanup actions meet the same touch-target standard as navigation.
- Make the compact mobile topbar overflow horizontally navigable so the new command action, session context, and existing controls remain reachable instead of overlapping at narrow widths.
- Localize the command palette’s session-loading state instead of leaving English-only copy visible in Chinese and Japanese.
- Localize the workspace login title, password prompt, unlock action, and authentication errors for English, Chinese, and Japanese users.
- Localize composer attachment limits, skipped-file explanations, read failures, and running-agent attachment errors for English, Chinese, and Japanese users.
- Localize composer retry-abort and attachment removal labels so mobile cleanup and recovery actions match the active interface language.
- Close the mobile topbar overflow when launching the command palette from its visible trigger, preventing the menu from remaining open behind the modal.
- Add localized retry actions to image, audio, and document viewer failures so transient file-loading problems can recover without closing the file panel.
- Keep the login card clear of device safe areas, enlarge password and unlock controls for touch use, and retain the shared focus-ring treatment.
- Add localized inline retry recovery to workspace directory-picker failures, so mobile users can recover without closing the picker.
- Enlarge directory-picker profile, launch toggle, and extra-argument controls on touch devices for reliable workspace setup on phones.
- Enlarge mobile Settings navigation tabs and provider segmented controls to 44px targets, keeping the horizontal Settings header easy to traverse on phones.
- Localize the document viewer’s PDF type label so file metadata remains consistent with the selected interface language.
- Localize workspace-picker profile and extra-argument accessible labels for English, Chinese, and Japanese users.
- Enlarge archive-browser search and clear controls on touch devices for reliable session-history filtering on phones.
- Enlarge MCP refresh, server selection, add-server, config fields, and action buttons on touch devices for reliable mobile server setup.
- Localize MCP connection, enabled/disabled, off, and invalid status labels for English, Chinese, and Japanese users.
- Localize agent discovery error, warning, and fallback diagnostic messages for English, Chinese, and Japanese users.
- Announce agent discovery errors with alert semantics while keeping warning-only diagnostics polite, so assistive technology distinguishes failures from informational notices.
- Give the archive search clear action an explicit localized **Clear search** accessible label instead of reusing the dialog close label.
- Enlarge agent reload, unpack, create, search, list, copy, save, cancel, and remove controls on touch devices for reliable mobile agent management.
- Localize bundled, user, and project agent scope badges so agent metadata remains readable across supported languages.
- Announce MCP configuration load failures with alert semantics while retaining polite status announcements for live-status connectivity notices.
- Expand the Settings switch hit area to 44px while preserving the existing 40×24 visual track and focus behavior.
- Replace the text-file viewer’s generic loading label with shape-matched skeleton lines and semantic busy state for smoother first paint.
- Replace the conversation session-loading label with shape-matched skeleton lines and semantic busy state for a calmer chat first paint.
- Enlarge the conversation session retry action on touch devices so a failed session can be recovered reliably from mobile.
- Expose Explorer directory and search loading state through `aria-busy`, improving assistive-technology feedback while mobile file navigation remains touch-friendly.
- Replace the initial workspace-validation label with a shape-matched skeleton and semantic busy state for a calmer first paint.
- Show the Ctrl/Cmd+K shortcut in the command-palette toolbar trigger’s tooltip while retaining the existing accessible shortcut metadata.
- Give the archive search input an explicit localized accessible label instead of relying on placeholder text alone.
- Refresh the OMP version shown in new sessions after a CLI update without requiring an omp-web server restart. Reuse results while executable metadata is unchanged, with a five-minute fallback expiry for launchers. Keep the last known version visible between visits and distinguish initial loading from an unavailable runtime.
- Add `OMP_WEB_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATE` to skip npm/OMP update checks and block in-app self-update actions, preserve the setting in service installers, and show the disabled state in Settings.
- Return browser host-tool and host-URI results as fire-and-forget frames while preserving OMP's original request ID, preventing `open_file` and clipboard bridge calls from hanging.
- Restore copy-success feedback after React Strict Mode re-runs effect setup.
- Cancel queued messages in OMP before removing their chips or recalling them for editing. Failed or timed-out cancellation leaves the message visible; successful recall survives composer remounts without losing newer typing. Requires native `remove_queued_message` support.
- Preserve question-dialog answers and selections when an SSE reconnect replays the same pending request or answer submission fails.
- Keep sent-message copy, edit, and fork actions visible without hover or a reveal tap. Also keep file mention/download, Git open-file actions, and sidebar menus visible alongside their metadata; wrap message actions on narrow screens.
- Expand complete tool inputs inline, including multiline code and edit patches, while keeping command previews compact and output visibility unchanged.
- Keep composer controls on one line, with equally sized Send, Stop, and Queue buttons and model names truncating before short effort labels.
- Align the + button and primary action with matching composer insets.
- Recover saved responses before reporting an empty agent reply after returning to a backgrounded page or PWA. Preserve provider errors and distinguish new runs from older answers.
- Catch up missed conversation entries incrementally after reconnecting or returning to the page, including during active runs. Restore quiet partial responses and live tool output without duplicating history or overwriting newer updates.
- Send prompts with image attachments in full again: commands reach OMP as one unchunked JSONL record. Protocol-v2 `rpc_chunk` framing is outbound-only, so any prompt over 1 MiB was rejected as `Unknown command: rpc_chunk` and reset the session after the prompt-ack timeout.
- Show the **New session** fork action below agent replies as well as user prompts, so the newest message in a conversation can fork the session. omp's `branch` command accepts a user entry only, so each reply forks at the prompt that started its turn; replies with no earlier prompt keep no fork action.
- Count subagents, advisors, `/tan` clones and extension helper sessions in Settings → **Usage**. Their model usage lives in transcripts inside each session's artifacts folder, which the Usage page never read. It counted only subagent summaries in `task` results, and background subagents leave those empty. These transcripts now count toward the session and project that own them. History copied by `/tan`, `/fork` or a branch counts once and moves to a remaining copy if the original is deleted, and a `task` summary counts only when no copy of its subagent's transcript exists. The `local://` scratch folder is not scanned. The usage cache rebuilds once on first load; when another omp-web version shares it, files that version synced are re-read.

## [v0.5.0] - 2026-09-12

This release brings live tool-output streaming, a workspace picker for new sessions, voice dictation, new themes, an activity timeline with transcript export, and a redesigned settings experience.

### Highlights

- **Live tool output**: Tool calls now show a running indicator with streamed output while the tool executes, instead of a dead row awaiting the result.
- **Workspace picker for new sessions**: Choose the destination workspace directly above the new-session composer, with workspace names, exact paths, and worktree preservation.
- **Voice dictation**: Provider-agnostic speech-to-text dictation in the composer.
- **New themes**: OMP Midnight plus popular light and dark palettes with previews and CommandPalette support.
- **Activity timeline**: Activity group summaries, a minimap rail, and transcript export.
- **Composer upgrades**: Plus menu, context-ring gauge, context detail panel, and a `/loop` command to repeat a task up to N attempts.
- **Redesigned settings**: Full-page centered layout with a provider grid.
- **Long-session stability**: Targeted cache invalidation, oversized-file handling, better error surfacing, and render optimization.

### Fixes & Improvements

- Keep Cancel and Submit reachable in mobile extension questions by scrolling long questions and answers above a fixed action row and sizing the editor for short viewports.
- Confirm session deletion and workspace removal in dialogs on desktop and mobile. Cancel leaves data untouched; workspace removal keeps files and sessions.
- Center the workspace/session breadcrumb over the conversation column, and keep mobile generation speed and file-panel controls clear of the panel toggle. Explorer actions now have a separate touch-sized toolbar on mobile.
- Keep the top bar on one row with a fixed-width speed readout: compact units such as t/s, kt/s, and Mt/s, and a same-width ~ marker for average speed. The full rate remains in the tooltip; the whole pill hides when it cannot fit, without clipping or scrolling.
- Keep the fixed-width speed readout visible on narrow screens, including 320px: show theme, language, history, branches, and system controls directly when their measured widths fit beside any visible speed readout, and use a More disclosure otherwise, without shrinking touch targets. New-session screens do not reserve space for an absent readout.
- Open the language menu to the right of its left-side toolbar trigger so all options remain visible in the mobile More disclosure and the desktop header.
- Keep resized file panels and their contents inside the window at intermediate widths and non-default interface scales, wrapping file and Explorer actions when space is tight.
- Keep session action menus visible on touch devices beside fixed-width, right-aligned timestamps, with larger tap targets and titles using the remaining row width.
- Keep workspace header action menus visible on touch devices without first selecting or expanding the workspace.
- Keep provider and OMP System navigation in one horizontally scrollable row on narrow screens, and keep Save and Cancel in normal flow with inline save errors.
- Hide the Steer action when the only queued message is already a steer, matching the expanded queue while keeping Edit and Delete available.
- Keep the theme picker inside the mobile viewport by opening it to the right of its toolbar anchor.
- Match browser and installed-app chrome to the selected theme, with OMP Midnight as the launch fallback.
- Open the conversation sidebar on Back before leaving in narrow, overlay-sidebar layouts. On every layout, warn before Back, reload, or close can discard unsent text or attachments. Cancel keeps the current conversation and drafts; switching conversations still preserves drafts.
- Keep unsent-content confirmation active across consecutive Back presses on Android Chrome, including after switching to a new session.
- Some installed browsers cannot close a directly launched app programmatically. After confirming Leave, use native Back or Close if prompted. Chrome may bypass sidebar-first Back until the first interaction after launch, and Android process termination can bypass page warnings.
- Show app-close guidance only in standalone installed apps, never in ordinary browser tabs.
